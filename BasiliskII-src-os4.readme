Basilisk II is an open source 68k Macintosh emulator. It can emulate
either a Mac Classic or a Mac II series machine with colour display
and sound.

 * RDB support.
 * Displays disk-image and partition size (when found!)
 * Mouse wheel support.
 * Hard-disk support for 64bit addressing.
 * Disk image support for 64bit addressing.
 * Supports 2,8,16 and 256 colors, 15bit, 32bit mac video modes.
 * Full screen uses native video modes, 8bit, 16bit, and 32bit.
 (LE and BE modes should work.)
 * Iconification support.
 * Smart emulation priority, (CPU emulation can be halted, 
 or set lower priority, when the emulator is not in focus.)
 * Supports CD-ROM
 * All PC keyboard keys are supported in emulation

(Se source code if you like to help, translations needed!)

DISCLAIMER:

* PARTITIONS:
DO NOT USE DH0, MAKE A NEW MAKE A NEW PARTITION AND CALL IT SOME THING SMART,
PARTITION WILL BE OVERWRITTEN !!! MAKE THE PARTITION NO LARGER THEN 2GB,
IF YOU LIKE TO BE SAFE USE SLOWER DISK-IMAGES.

* IF YOU DO GET DSI ERRORS, DO NOT IGNORE ERRORS, BE SAFE; WARM REBOOT.
MACINTOSH SOFTWARE CAN HAVE BUGS, THERE IS NO MEMORY PROTECTION THAT CAN STOP IT FROM CRASHING YOUR SYSTEM.
(IF YOU DO THIS THE IT'S ON YOUR OWN RISK.)

* POWERUP USERS:
IT IS PROBABLY BETTER RUN SHAPESHIFTER OR FUSION ON
THE 68K THAN BASILISK II ON THE PPC. BASILISK II USES UAE CPU ENGINE AND
BPPC/CSPPC IS TOO SLOW.

* ETHERNET CODE:
I DID NOT BREAK IT NEVER WORKED ON AMIGAOS4.
I THINK IT MIGHT WORK NOW, IF ITS JUST A MACOS ISSUE, BUT FOR ME ITS NOT WORKING.
I HAVE LOOKED FOR SOMETHING LIKE TCPDUMP FOR MAC HAVE NOT FOUND ANY.

Changes in Basilisk II 1.0.8 AmigaOS4 26.12.2020 (Kjetil Hvalstrand)

* Found bug in ether_amiga.cpp did not convert host address to macos address,
* Added improved debuging, ascii/hex dump
* Added a option to enable or disable network monitoring.

(I hope someone see way this is not working.... 
if its working for you please give some hints MacOS version,
Open Transport version, etc.)

Changes in Basilisk II 1.0.7 AmigaOS4 26.12.2020 (Kjetil Hvalstrand)

* Frensh translation added (abalabanb).
* Fixed palette problem on 32bit screens using window mode.
* Faster converters for 32bit workbench screens.
(4bit to 32bit, 8bit to 32bit)
* Window composition, was updated to the same converters as window mode.
* Newly rewitten the ether_amiga.cpp from 2008 insted of old code from 2001 (Basilisk 0.9).
(This code now uses powerpc emulation stubs. it did not before.)
Disclamer: Don't expect network code to work, I do get crashes some where else.
* Minor bug fixes.
* Made sure Window mode and Window composition, does draw graphics while window is closed.
* Faster converters for 8bit full screen mode.
(1bit to 8bit, 2bit to 8bit, 4bit to 8bit)

Changes in Basilisk II 1.0.6 AmigaOS4 05.12.2020 (Kjetil Hvalstrand)

* Fixed make_lha script
* New install readmed for AmigaOS4.1 only.
* Fixed a problem with a newer compiler.
* Now create a new mode if default width and height don't 
match modes (in window mode)
* Fixed some typos, locale/basilisk.cd
* Window close warning now support catalogs
* Line skip / frame skip can now set different depending on if the window is active or deactive.
(Can be useful while unstuffing or doing things on the Amiga side, will free up some CPU cycles.)
* New Hot keys 
LALT +LSHIFT+CTRL+key "+"	Increment frame skip.
LALT +LSHIFT+CTRL+key "-"	Decrement frame skip.
LALT +LSHIFT+CTRL+key "Print screen"	Power off
* line_skip now works.
* Removed frame_dice code, obsolete
* Fixed bad values for frame_skip and line_skip
* Video_mutex now moved to init.cpp
* Converter 2x8bit pixels to 2x16bit pixels in one go. 
* Converter 2x4bit pixels to 2x16bit pixels in one go. 

Changes in Basilisk II 1.0.5 AmigaOS4 23.11.2020 (Kjetil Hvalstrand)

* Removed all Picasso96 code, its no longer native to AmigaOS4.1 Final update 1
* AmigaOS 16 bit LE Screen Mode now supported.
* Mac 2bit, 4bit modes now supported.
* 15bit BE to 16bit LE conversion code now use lookup table. (makes this really fast)
* B/W, 2bit, 4bit graphics can now be displayed on 16 modes.
* Iconificaton of window support for composition and normal window.
* Iconificaton will suspend CPU emulation while iconified freeing up the CPU.
* Composition code rewritten.
* Window active / inactive event will regulate cpu task emulation priority. 
so AmigaOS is not staved from CPU cycles, when your trying to do stuff on the Amiga side.
* Samo79 provided italien catalog file.
* GUI: Will correly display width and height if fullscreen is selected.
* GUI: CPU info moved to its own TAB/Page
* Updated the make_lha script, to include locale files.
* A lot of obsolete warnings fixed.
* Now uses 64bit Seek instead old 32bit Seek for disk images 
* You can now create large disk images >4Gbytes
(Note this does not automatic allow you to use large disk images, MacOS also needs to support it.).
* Added some code to force CPU emulation to quit (as it got stuck).
* Buggy exit code fixed, it did not set NULL after freeing devices, resulting bad things.
* -lauto removed, bad OpenLibrary / CloseLibrary code replaced.
* Prefs files now stored in program directory, makes it easier when you backup, 
or upgrade the OS, (no lost prefs files anymore.)
* Added a worning message, if you try to quit Basilisk II.

Changes in Basilisk II 1.0.4 AmigaOS4 03.01.2014 (Kjetil Hvalstrand)

* Added "Uae lock on screens bitmap" in GUI for AGP/PCI graphic cards.
* added support for bitmap looking in amiga_video.cpp

* Optimized sysdeps.h for AmigaOS4; now use inline powerpc asm.
* Added min/max values frame skip and line skip.
* Small fix: line_skip = 0 is now no line_skip (like before), and line skip=1 is one line skip (new).
* Added window/boot depth option to gui under system tab.

Changes in Basilisk II 0.9.8 experimental AmigaOS4 22.06.2012

* Merged changes from Scott A. Cabit

* prefs files can now be read from different directory, by entering a different path as argument in shell.
* fixed ether_amiga4.cpp (SanaII), hooks are not setup correct.
(warning think the exit code is broken)

[-- Inifity TCP/IP - driver experimental --]
* Fixed initial NULL value not set for msg-port used for Ethernet, dangers on exit.
* Experminantal TCP/IP api added (not SanaII).

seriala & serialb
  The Parallel checkbox now works, if deselected it is possible to connect via
modem to the internet
* Added device USBDisk.device to CD drive list - you can now access USB based CD
drives

implemented in the emulator
  but it now works in the Amiga OS4 prefs gui and prefs file
* Incremented experimental version numbers in Os4_prefs file to show 9.7

Differences to AmigaOS3.x/Classic Amiga version:

This version doesnt run MacOS "natively" (natively as in virtual 68k engine in
AmigaOS4/MorphOS) but uses UAE 68k emulation engine. Performance is relatively poor but
good enough to run demanding 68k games (040 was the best CPU used on 68k Mac).

Support for Mac HD floppies is removed because built-in floppy controller on
Pegasos is not supported in MorphOS.

NSD and P96 support was removed since it is not relevant on MorphOS.

AHI support was rewritten and uses high level API instead of old lowlevel API
which blocked other musical programs. It also defaults to 48000Hz/16bit now.

The largest possible MacOS RAM size is 1024MB but the minimum is 16MB.

SCSI no longer respects CHIP/24BITDMA flags.
